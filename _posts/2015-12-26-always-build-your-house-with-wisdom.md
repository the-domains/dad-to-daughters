# Always Build Your House With Wisdom
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a1a36e47-a0da-4c51-8928-85d7b9a806ec.png)

This is the first letter to my daughters that I love very, very much.

My Girls,

I am writing to you on this beautiful Sunday, the 14th of November, 2010\. It is 10:33am and the sky is clear.

At the moment, you both are in the reading room watching a movie on the laptop. I'm sure in your present time, laptops are a thing of the past.

So I know you're asking why I wrote you this and many others letters to come. I will answer those questions in future letters.

I would like to end this letter by telling you that I love you both and always build your house with wisdom. It carries your soul.
