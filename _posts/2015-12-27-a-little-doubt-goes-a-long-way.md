# A Little Doubt Goes A Long Way

My girls,

It is 7:34pm on Friday, November 19th, 2010\. I love you both.

When I was younger, I used to sit around and listen to my elders as they talked about life, "The Good Lord," and everyday wisdom. One day while visiting, an elder pulled out his book of wisdom and read this passage to me ...

"If anyone lacks wisdom, ask God for it, and it will be given.But when asking, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. That person should not expect to receive anything. Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do."

This message really inspired me and I decided that day to never doubt again. It didn't take long for me to realize it may be impossible for me to never doubt. In fact, I was already doubting myself soon after I had vowed to never think that way again. Ten years passed and I wasn't doubt-free so I threw in the towel; I embraced doubt and made it an additional teacher.

Over the years, I have discovered doubt and wisdom walk hand in hand; they are one in the same.In my first letter to you both, I encouraged you to build your house with wisdom. Well, knowing the true nature of doubt can help you be more understanding and loving to yourself and others; your house will sit on solid ground.

It is true that trusting yourself and having confidence will help to eliminate any uncertainty that may arise in you life, but always remember this ...

**A little doubt will take you far**.

Before I close this letter, know this ...In your lifetime, embrace doubt and don't try and wrangle it. Your days will be brighter. I love you both.
