# Bread And Water Amidst A Banquet

My girls,

It is 2:24pm on a lovely Wednesday, November 17th, 2010\. The sky is clear and bright. Before you both read this letter, I want to tell you I love you.

Today I want to spend a moment and share a mental exercise with you that I call**Bread and Water**. Let's begin.

**The Bread**-- Exercise to clear your mind

Start by closing your eyes. Inhale calmly through your nose ...now exhale calmly out of your mouth. Repeat this breathing until the [gentle answer][0] within you arises and quiets your space. If a tear arises, let your cry be your own. If laughter arises, laugh and giggle as long as you wish. Embrace whatever arises until you reach that quiet space. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1b2280fa-cd2f-4c72-a5f8-002a608ba10e.jpg)

Now mentally place yourself at an overlook. Look at all of the mountains, trees and clouds in the distance. While standing there, say these words to yourself ...

**I am content and at peace**.

Say this as long as you please.

**The Water**-- Exercise to clear your soul

Now I want you both to mentally place yourselves in the middle of a heavily populated location; I call this the**banquet**. You could be there walking or standing still. Each time you pass or encounter someone, I want you to say these words to the person ...

**You are content and at peace**.

Tell as many people as you wish.

Thank you both for letting me share Bread and Water with you. Remember, this is a mental exercise. Mainly, I just wanted you both to know that there is always bread and water amidst a banquet; no matter where you are, you can always be content and at peace. I love you both very much.
